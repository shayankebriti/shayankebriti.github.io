I notice you've sent a "1" but I'm not sure what specific changes or help you're looking for. I can see you have a navigation configuration file open (`_data/navigation.yml`) that defines the main navigation links for what appears to be a personal or academic website.

Could you please let me know what you'd like to do with this navigation file? For example:
1. Would you like to add new navigation items?
2. Would you like to modify existing items?
3. Would you like help understanding how this navigation configuration works?
4. Or something
